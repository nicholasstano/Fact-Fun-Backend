## Fact Fun

Welcome to the Fact Fun Backend!

## Demo

[Try it!](https://mildlyconfused.github.io/Fact-Fun/test.html)

## Motivation

Quite simply, whe discovered the CIA World Factbook API and thought, "how can we _not_ use this!?" It was extra fun too, because as part of our entrance exam we had to pass an infamous exercise known as "Hashketball", and the JSON data was so deeply nested this felt like "Hashketball 2!"

## Build Status

Fact fun is likely in its final state.

## Code Style

Indentation.

## Frameworks

This app uses a Rails API backend to track user scores with a Vanilla Javascript.

## Installation

Clone it down and use the command `rails s` command to start the backend.

## How to use

When you've opened test.html from the frontend, either sign up or log in. Once you're logged in, you can play the game! Read over the facts presented, and click the one of four presented countries you believe is the country being described. If you're right, you get points! If not, you don't! Either way, it's fun!
